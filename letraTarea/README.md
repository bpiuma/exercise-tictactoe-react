Time to start building cool stuff, let's code our first game!

![TicTacToe Preview](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-tictactoe-react/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository.

The first step to start coding is cloning the [react.js boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello) on your local computer or opening it using gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: `$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello`.

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üìù Instructions

Create a Tictactoe in React.js just like [this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-tictactoe-react/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true). Remember to follow the recommended workflow to start coding:

1. Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?
2. Designing your wireframe: What components and where?
3. Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on each of them (to make sure they work).
4. Create a list of all the possible user and system interactions (events) that occure during runtime (for example: The user clicks on a button to start the game)
6. Create a javascript functions that will handle each of those events.
7. `Console.log` on each of those funtions to make sure they are being called.
9. Continue... whatch the video if you have any other doubts.

### Concepts you wil learn:

- State of the components (global variables)
- Props
- Render method
- The function for checking the winner is a great learning algorithm
